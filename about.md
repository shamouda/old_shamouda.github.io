I am a PhD Student in the Research School of Computer Science, at the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/).
I am passionate about taming unreliable computer clusters by designing disaster-ready distributed systems.

I started my PhD in 02/2014, and I expect to submit my thesis by 08/2018.
My thesis title is **'Resilience in High-Level Parallel Programming Languages'**, where 
I address issues related to performance and productivity of resilient runtime systems.
In particular, I work on enhancing the resilience support of the [X10 language](http://x10-lang.org/) in collaboration with the X10 team at IBM T. J. Watson Research center.

My PhD advisors are [Josh Milthorpe](http://www.milthorpe.org/), [Steve Blackburn](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/), and [Peter Strazdins](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~peter/)

Between 2006 and 2014, I was a teaching assistant in the Faculty of Computers and Information, at [Cairo University](http://cu.edu.eg/Home). I obtained my masters degree in 2010 and my bachelor degree in 2006, both from Cairo University.
